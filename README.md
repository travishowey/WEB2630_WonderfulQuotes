# WEB 2630 Wonderful Quotes
> We have learned a great amount about components and now is time to bring it all together with Project 2. You will be building a quote application. In this application, you will be able to add quotes to your page that is tracked with a progress bar. This progress bar will allow you to add 10 quotes to the page. Once it hits 10 quotes it will warn the user that you need to remove a quote before adding another. In order to remove a quote from your application, you can just select the quote to remove it. To add a quote you will have a text field that you can type the quote into and have a button that you can click to Add the Quote.
